Mission If you&amp;rsquo;re running Docker on a host that is exposed to the Internet (network bridge), you will probably want to restrict external access.
2. Docker network Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a fact that Docker manipulates iptables rules to provide network isolation, on Linux. Docker installs custom iptables chains named DOCKER, DOCKER-USER and DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-*, and it ensures that incoming packets are always checked by these chains first.

Using Github&amp;rsquo;s issue feature as a backend for comments is a very elegant solution IM O: no tracking, no ads, simple. But today, I decide to switch to a better alternative - Giscus. Giscus is heavily inspired by Utterances except one thing: instead of using Github issues it uses the fairly new Discussions features to store comments.

2. Swap partition size 2.1. Old rule of thumb swap: 2 * the-amount-of-RAM So if a computer had 64KB of RAM, a swap partition of 128KB would be an optimum size.

By combining with Prometheus pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) to add and remove additional instances automatically, when they are needed.
