Mission If you&amp;rsquo;re running Docker on a host that is exposed to the Internet (network bridge), you will probably want to restrict external access.
2. Docker network Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a fact that Docker manipulates iptables rules to provide network isolation, on Linux. Docker installs custom iptables chains named DOCKER, DOCKER-USER and DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-*, and it ensures that incoming packets are always checked by these chains first.

Using Github&amp;rsquo;s issue feature as a backend for comments is a very elegant solution IM O: no tracking, no ads, simple. But today, I decide to switch to a better alternative - Giscus. Giscus is heavily inspired by Utterances except one thing: instead of using Github issues it uses the fairly new Discussions features to store comments.
So..
Why migrate? Post reactions: utterances allows you to add reactions to comments but as an author Iâ€™m also interested in the general reception of the post itself.</description></item><item><title>Bgp Ecmp Load Balancing</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/bgp-ecmp-load-balancing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 15:35:08 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/bgp-ecmp-load-balancing/</guid><description>1.

What is Swap? Swap file systems support virtual memory, data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing.
2. Swap partition size 2.1. Old rule of thumb swap = 2 * the-amount-of-RAM So if a computer had 64KB of RAM, a swap partition of 128KB would be an optimum size. This rule took into the facts that RAM sizes were typically quite small at the time.</description></item><item><title>Ansitheus</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/ansitheus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 13:51:59 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/ansitheus/</guid><description>Ansitheus = Ansible + Prometheus 1.

1. Context Etcd Version v3.4.0.
2. Requirements 2.1. Number of nodes &amp;gt;= 3 nodes. A etcd cluster needs a majority of nodes, a quorum to agree on updates to the cluster state. For a cluster with n-members, quorum is (n/2)+1. 2.2. CPUs Etcd doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of CPU capacity. Typical clusters need 2-4 cores to run smoothly.</description></item><item><title>Openstack Autoscaling New Approach</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/openstack-autoscaling-new-approach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 21:19:38 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/openstack-autoscaling-new-approach/</guid><description>NOTE(kiennt): There is a legacy Faythe guideline. The new version is coming soon, check its repository for status.
This guide describes how to automatically scale out your Compute instances in response to heavy system usage. By combining with Prometheus pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) to add and remove additional instances automatically, when they are needed.

The standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach before goes to the new approach.</description></item><item><title>Lets Comment</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/lets-comment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 09:47:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/posts/lets-comment/</guid><description>Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript. But Disqus generates a shit load of page requests and heavy contents&amp;hellip; which even with the benefits that come with having Disqus in place. People just want something that can be used to post a comment, that is.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I choose a Disqus alternative - Utterances. Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on Github issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
