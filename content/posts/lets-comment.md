Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript. But Disqus generates a shit load of page requests and heavy contents... which even with the benefits that come with having Disqus in place. People just want something that can be used to post a comment, that is.

That's why I choose a Disqus alternative - [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/). Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on Github issues. Use Github issues for blog comments, wiki pages and more!

* Open source. 🙌

* No tracking, no ads, always free. 📡🚫

* No lock-in. All data stored in GitHub issues. 🔓

* Styled with Primer, the css toolkit that powers GitHub. 💅

* Lightweight. Vanilla TypeScript. No font downloads, JavaScript frameworks or polyfills for evergreen browsers. 🐦🌲

Setting up Utterances is quite simple, just follow the home page instruction and you will get what you want.

So, let's post some comments here.
