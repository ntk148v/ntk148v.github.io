## Willingness to look stupid

I recently read [this article](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/) by Dan Luu (what a clickbait headline). At first, this seems like a terrible (and stupid) idea. Who wants to look stupid? But after read the whole article, I get the point.

People avoid looking stupid even though they may not fully understanding something, and honestly I do the same thing :man_facepalming:. I'd keep my mouth shut rather than ask questions to clarify the problem, most of the time (at work, at some conferences, at university, ...). And I know that I'm not the only one, look smart but being stupid.

There's [a huge difference between stupid and looking stupid. Sometimes looking stupid means you're willing to ask necessary questions to wrap your head around a problem or concept](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/soreniverson_willingness-to-look-stupid-activity-6859517714659123200-cytw/).

_Be willing to look stupid._

Template to look stupid, get it from [Hacker News's thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28942189):

```unknow
"I'm going to ask stupid questions now, <insert my question here>"

"Just so I'm understanding the problem, <here's my interpretation of what you just said>."
```

## Leadership

## Company culture

Basically a common tactic of corporations is to espouse "we are family" but it is just a manipulation tactic for employees to work long-hours and to give their all to the company. The "we are a family" mantra would be fine if it was coupled with a healthy separation of work and life; with the biggest indicator being that healthy working hours (8-9 work hours only) is maintained.

In contrast, something like Netflix culture which is "we are a team and not a family" seems like to be more a healthier alternative. On a last point, the "we are family" (i.e. we care about our employees as persons instead of just means or cogs) mantra is fine but it usually turns into "we are a toxic family" (i.e. give your all to the company) instead of it being a "we are a healthy family" (i.e. our company values each employee).
