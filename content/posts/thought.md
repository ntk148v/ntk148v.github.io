I recently read [this article](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/) by Dan Luu (what a clickbait headline). At first, this seems like a terrible (and stupid) idea. Who wants to look stupid? But after read the whole article, I get the point.

People avoid looking stupid even though they may not fully understanding something, and honestly I do the same thing :man\*facepalming:. I'd keep my mouth shut rather than ask questions to clarify the problem, most of the time (at work, at some conferences, at university, ...). And I know that I'm not the only one, look smart but being stupid.

There's [a huge difference between stupid and looking stupid. Sometimes looking stupid means you're willing to ask necessary questions to wrap your head around a problem or concept](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/soreniverson_willingness-to-look-stupid-activity-6859517714659123200-cytw/).

_Be willing to look stupid._

Template to look stupid, get it from [Hacker News's thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28942189):

```unknow
"I'm going to ask stupid questions now, <insert my question here>"

"Just so I'm understanding the problem, <here's my interpretation of what you just said>."
```
